<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a state-of-the-art Cognitive Oracle Trading Platform. The project has evolved through multiple phases, adding features like a 3D trading avatar, voice commands, real-time data, a trading journal, and social signals.

The most recent user requests are to make the platform production-ready and then add a new phase of features.
**Production-Ready Requirements:**
- A mock trading playground with virtual money.
- An autonomous AI trading bot with configurable strategies.
- An interactive training system for users.
- A structure for real exchange and social media integrations.

**Next Phase Feature Requirements:**
- A React Native mobile application.
- Integration with additional exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken).
- Advanced ML-powered prediction models.
- A trading competition feature with leaderboards and prizes.
- Integration with Benzinga for news alerts.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive full-stack trading application built with React, FastAPI, and a modularized backend using MongoDB.

- **Backend:** A FastAPI server with a modular architecture. It provides APIs for market data, user authentication, a trading journal, portfolio leaderboards, social signals, a trading playground (paper trading), an autonomous AI bot, an interactive training system, and placeholders for ML predictions and trading competitions.
- **Frontend:** A sophisticated React application with a glassmorphism UI. It includes a 3D trading avatar with real-time facial tracking, multi-language support, theme toggling, and dedicated components for all major features, including the newly added Trading Playground, AI Bot, and Training Center.
- **PWA:** The application is a Progressive Web App with a manifest and service worker for push notifications.

**Last working item**:
The agent was implementing the Next Phase Features requested by the user, starting with the backend modules and frontend components for ML Predictions and Trading Competitions.

- **Last item agent was working:** The agent had just created the backend modules for additional exchanges, ML predictions, and trading competitions. It integrated and tested the new API endpoints via . It then created the frontend component for ML Predictions () and was about to create the component for the Trading Competitions.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N (Only backend endpoints were curl-tested; frontend components are not fully integrated or tested).
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding blocking issues. The previous data loading issue with P6 features was resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Next Phase Features Implementation (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The agent has created the backend modules and the  frontend component. The immediate next steps are:
        1. Create the frontend component for Trading Competitions: .
        2. Create the frontend component for Benzinga news alerts.
        3. Integrate , , and the Benzinga component into  with new navigation tabs and icons.
        4. Begin scaffolding the React Native mobile app in a new  directory.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** This will add advanced predictive analytics and gamification to the platform, integrate a key news source, and start the development of the mobile application.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P7.1 (P0):** Integrate Coinbase and Kraken exchange adapters into the backend  module, including testnet support.
    - **P7.2 (P1):** Implement the UI for managing real exchange API keys (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) and social media keys (Twitter, Reddit) in the user settings.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **P8:** Full implementation and build-out of the React Native mobile application.
    - **Integration:** Connect to real Twitter/Reddit APIs once the user provides API keys.
    - **ML:** Implement and train custom ML models (e.g., using /) to replace the current mocked prediction logic.

**Completed work in this session**
- **P6 Data Loading Issue (RESOLVED):** Fixed the critical bug where , , and  components were not displaying data. The fix involved optimizing the backend API to make audio data load on-demand and resolving a CORS misconfiguration.
- **Enhanced Webcam Facial Tracking (DONE):** Implemented real-time facial expression mirroring from the user's webcam onto the 3D avatar using MediaPipe's 468-point face mesh.
- **P6 Feature Testing (DONE):** Successfully ran a comprehensive E2E test suite (28/28 tests passed) using the testing agent to validate all P6 features after the fixes.
- **Production-Ready Features (DONE):**
    - **Backend:** Created and integrated modular backend services for a Trading Playground, Autonomous AI Bot, Interactive Training System, and placeholders for exchange/social integrations.
    - **Frontend:** Created and integrated UI components (, , ).
    - **E2E Testing:** Successfully ran a second E2E test suite (32/32 tests passed) to validate all new production-ready features.
- **Next Phase Scaffolding (IN PROGRESS):**
    - **Backend:** Created backend modules and API endpoints for Additional Exchanges (), ML Predictions (), and Trading Competitions ().
    - **Frontend:** Created the  component.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue:** The application's complexity and use of memory-intensive libraries (Three.js, TensorFlow.js) pose a risk of hitting memory limits, which previously caused a pod restart.
- **Recurrence count:** 1
- **Status:** RESOLVED (by pod restart), but remains a background risk.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Three.js, MediaPipe, i18next, Framer Motion, Recharts.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- You are in the middle of a large feature implementation phase. The backend modules for the Next Phase Features (ML, Competitions, Exchanges) have been created and tested with .
- Your immediate task is to build out the corresponding frontend components (, Benzinga alerts), integrate them into the UI, and then start the React Native project.
- The user has approved all proposed features and expects them to be production-ready. This implies robust implementation and testing.
- API keys for real exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken) and social media (Twitter, Reddit) are still pending from the user. Build the integration structure so keys can be added later.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  (Updated with P6 and production-ready features).
-  (P6 Features E2E Test Report).
