- **P2:** Social/copy trading, advanced candlestick charts, portfolio analytics, and a paper trading mode.
- **P3:** Mobile responsive optimization, price alert notifications, advanced order types (limit, stop-loss), a live newsfeed, auto-trading capabilities, and an individual user portal with a wallet.
- **P4:** Trading history export (CSV/PDF), multi-language support, and a real-time trade crawler.
- **P5:** A 3D interactive voice trading avatar, real API integrations for news/whale alerts, browser push notifications, and a theme toggle.
- **P6 (Current):** A Trading Journal, multi-user portfolio sharing/leaderboard, enhanced webcam facial tracking, and enhanced social signal simulation.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive full-stack trading application built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The platform is highly feature-rich, developed over several iterations.

- **Backend:** A FastAPI server provides API endpoints for market data (simulated and from CoinGecko/blockchain.info), user authentication, WebSocket connections, AI agent consensus (mocked), OpenAI TTS, trading history, a trading journal, and portfolio leaderboards.
- **Frontend:** A sophisticated React application featuring a glassmorphism and Matrix themed UI. It includes a 3D trading avatar (Three.js), multi-language support (i18next), theme toggling, and numerous components for the platform's features.
- **Features Implemented:**
    - **MVP, P1, P2:** Core dashboard, real-time data, auth, social trading, charts, analytics, paper trading.
    - **P3:** Price alerts, advanced orders, newsfeed, auto-trading, user wallet.
    - **P4:** Data export (CSV/PDF), multi-language support, real-time trade signals crawler.
    - **P5:** 3D voice-interactive trading avatar, theme toggling (dark/light/matrix), push notification manager, and voice-activated trading commands.
    - **P6 (In Progress):** Backend endpoints and frontend components for Trading Journal, Portfolio Leaderboard, and Enhanced Social Signals have been created. A PWA manifest has been added.

**Last working item**:
The agent was implementing the P6 feature set. It created the backend APIs and frontend components, integrated them into the app, and attempted to verify them.

- **Last item agent was working:** Verifying the new P6 UI components (, , ) via screenshots after integrating them. The agent observed that the components were rendering but the data was not loading, likely due to an API or data-fetching issue. The last log showed a CoinGecko API returned 429 error, indicating rate limiting.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0):** P6 features are not loading data. The new components (, , ) render but remain empty.
  - **Attempted fixes:** The agent took screenshots, noticed the problem, and was about to re-investigate before the session ended.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  Check the browser console log from the last screenshot attempt () for frontend errors.
    2.  Check the backend logs (==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==

    3.  Examine the data fetching logic within , , and  to see how they handle loading states and API errors.
    4.  Implement a fix, which may involve adding a caching layer for CoinGecko data, handling the 429 error gracefully, or fixing a bug in the frontend state management.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete the core implementation of the P6 features and unblock testing.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1 (P0):** Complete and verify the P6 feature implementation.
     - **Where to resume:** Resume from debugging **Issue 1**. After fixing the data loading problem, proceed with:
        1.  Retaking screenshots of the Journal, Leaderboard, and Signals tabs to confirm the UI and data render correctly.
        2.  Implementing the Enhanced Webcam Facial Tracking feature, which was part of the P6 plan but not yet started. This involves integrating the user's live webcam feed with the MediaPipe library to mirror their facial expressions onto the 3D avatar in real-time.
        3.  Running  for a comprehensive E2E test of all P6 features.
     - **What will be achieved with this?** This will finalize the P6 feature request from the user and ensure the application is stable.
     - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
     - **Blocked on something:** Blocked on **Issue 1**.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **P6.2 (P0):** Enhanced Webcam Facial Tracking: Integrate a real webcam feed with MediaPipe (468-point mesh) to mirror the user's emotions and attention onto the 3D avatar. This is part of the current approved work.
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **P7:** Full React Native mobile app development. The user has agreed to defer this.
  - **Integration:** Real social media API integration (Twitter/Reddit) once the user can provide the necessary API keys.

**Completed work in this session**
- **P3 Features Completion:** Verified and successfully tested Price Alerts, Advanced Orders, Newsfeed, Auto-Trading, and the User Wallet.
- **P4 Features Implementation:** Implemented and tested Trading History Export (CSV/PDF), multi-language support with a language selector, and a Trade Crawler panel.
- **P5 Features Implementation:**
  - **3D Trading Avatar:** Created and fixed a 3D interactive avatar with a 68-point face mesh using Three.js and MediaPipe.
  - **Voice Integration:** Integrated OpenAI TTS for avatar voice synthesis and implemented voice-activated trading commands (Buy 1 BTC).
  - **Real-time Data:** Integrated a real blockchain API for whale transaction alerts.
  - **UI Enhancements:** Added a theme toggle (Dark/Light/Matrix) and a push notification manager.
- **P6 Scaffolding:** Created backend endpoints and frontend components for the Trading Journal, Portfolio Leaderboard, and Social Signals. Added a PWA .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue:** The agent previously encountered a memory limit that caused the pod to terminate and restart.
- **Recurrence count:** 1
- **Status:** RESOLVED (by pod restart), but remains a risk given the application's increasing complexity and use of memory-intensive libraries like Three.js and TensorFlow.js.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Three.js (for 3D avatar), MediaPipe (for facial recognition), i18next (for localization), Framer Motion, Recharts.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, WebSockets, aiohttp, ReportLab (for PDF generation), OpenAI (for TTS).
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Architecture:** Full-stack monolith with real-time WebSocket communication.
- **UI/UX:** Glassmorphism, Ephemeral UI, Matrix theme, 3D Voice-Interactive Avatar.

**key DB schema**
- **Users:** For authentication (Google OAuth).
- **MarketData:** Storing cached prices.
- **Trades:** For paper trading and portfolio tracking.
- **Alerts:** User-defined price alerts.
- **JournalEntries:** Storing daily performance summaries, P&L, win rates, and AI insights.
- **Portfolios:** User profiles, holdings, and performance for the leaderboard.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Priority 1 is fixing the P6 data loading issue.** The app is in a broken state. Investigate the  error as the most likely root cause. This rate-limiting issue may be preventing data from loading across multiple new components.
- The user has approved a large P6 feature set. After fixing the current issue, the next step is to implement the Enhanced Webcam Facial Tracking to complete the P6 work before a final round of testing.
- React Native mobile app development is deferred to a future phase (P7).
