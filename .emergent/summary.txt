<analysis>An analysis of the user's request, the agent's actions, and the overall progress of building the Cognitive Oracle Trading Platform.

**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a state-of-the-art Cognitive Oracle Trading Platform.

**Initial MVP requirements included:**
- Glassmorphism design with an ephemeral UI.
- Voice-first interface, facial recognition, and gesture control.
- A multi-agent AI consensus system and an Oracle memory for historical trade lookups.
- Minimalist design with real-time status badges.
- Integration of capabilities from XTrend, eToro, and TradingView.

**Subsequent features added in phases:**
- **P1:** Real webcam facial recognition (TensorFlow.js), WebSocket for live prices (from CoinGecko), and User Authentication (Google OAuth).
- **P2:** Social/copy trading, advanced candlestick charts, portfolio analytics, and a paper trading mode.
- **P3 (Current):** Mobile responsive optimization, price alert notifications, advanced order types (limit, stop-loss), a live newsfeed, auto-trading capabilities, and an individual user portal with a wallet. The user also requested a fix for misaligned buttons on the control panel.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive full-stack trading application built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The platform is highly feature-rich, developed over several iterations.

- **Backend:** A FastAPI server provides API endpoints for market data (simulated and from CoinGecko), user authentication, WebSocket connections, and AI agent consensus (mocked).
- **Frontend:** A sophisticated React application featuring a glassmorphism and Matrix themed UI. It includes numerous components for displaying data and interacting with the platform.
- **Features Implemented:**
    - **MVP:** Core dashboard layout with mock data for most panels (Live Markets, Voice, Facial/Gesture Recognition, Agent Consensus, Oracle Memory).
    - **P1:** Integration of real-time crypto data from CoinGecko via WebSockets, Google OAuth for user authentication, and a component for real webcam facial recognition.
    - **P2:** Fully functional tabs for Social/Copy Trading, Advanced Candlestick Charts, Portfolio Analytics, and a Paper Trading mode.
    - **P3 (In Progress):** Components for Price Alerts, Advanced Order Types, a Live Newsfeed, Auto-Trading strategies, and a User Wallet have been created and added to the UI. The control panel button layout has been fixed.

**Last working item**:
The agent was in the process of implementing and verifying a large batch of new features requested by the user.

- **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the P3 feature set, which includes advanced orders, price alerts, a news feed, auto-trading, and a user wallet. The agent had created all the necessary components, integrated them into the main , and was sequentially verifying each new tab via screenshots. The last action was verifying the Auto Trading tab.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N (Only partial visual verification of the newly added tabs was performed using screenshots. A full end-to-end test is pending.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - **Issue 1 (P0):** Fix misaligned buttons on the control panel.
    - **Status:** The agent has already attempted a fix by overwriting , but this has not been verified by a testing agent or screenshot. This needs to be confirmed during the next testing cycle.

**In progress Task List**:
  - **Task 1 (P0):** Complete and verify the P3 feature implementation.
     - **Where to resume:**
        1.  Take a screenshot of the User Wallet tab to visually verify its UI, similar to how other P3 features were checked. The file is .
        2.  Run the  to perform a comprehensive end-to-end test of all the new features (Price Alerts, Advanced Orders, News Feed, Auto Trading, User Wallet) and to ensure no regressions were introduced.
        3.  Address any bugs or failures reported by the testing agent.
     - **What will be achieved with this?** This will finalize the current feature request from the user and ensure the application is stable.
     - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
     - **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- There are no explicit future tasks requested by the user. After the current P3 features are completed and verified, the next step would be to ask the user for feedback or suggest further enhancements.

**Completed work in this session**
- **MVP:**
  - Implemented the core UI structure with a splash screen and main dashboard.
  - Created numerous components for the initial vision, including , , , , , , , and more.
- **P1 Features:**
  - Integrated real-time market data using CoinGecko and WebSockets (, ).
  - Added user authentication via Google OAuth (, , ).
  - Implemented a component for webcam-based facial recognition ().
- **P2 Features & Enhancement:**
  - Added Social/Copy Trading ().
  - Implemented Advanced Candlestick Charts ().
  - Added Portfolio Analytics view ().
  - Implemented a TensorFlow.js based facial recognition module ().
  - Added a Paper Trading mode ().
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed a backend issue where the crypto market data endpoint would fail if the cache was empty by adding a fallback mechanism.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. The agent has addressed all known issues so far.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue:** The agent previously encountered a memory limit that caused the pod to terminate and restart (). This happened after adding several new components and attempting to take a screenshot.
- **Recurrence count:** 1
- **Status:** RESOLVED (by pod restart with more memory), but it remains a risk.
- **Note:** The new agent should be mindful of memory consumption, especially when dealing with memory-intensive libraries like TensorFlow.js or when adding many new components at once.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Recharts, TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, WebSockets, aiohttp.
- **Database:** MongoDB (implied, via ).
- **Architecture:** Full-stack monolith with a React frontend calling a FastAPI backend. Real-time updates are pushed via WebSockets.
- **UI/UX:** Glassmorphism, Ephemeral UI elements, Dark Mode with a Matrix style animated background.

**key DB schema**
- Schemas are not explicitly defined with models but are implied by the data structures used in . Key data would include:
  - **Users:** For authentication.
  - **MarketData:** Storing cached prices for stocks and crypto.
  - **Trades:** For paper trading and portfolio tracking.

**All files of reference**
- : The single source of all backend logic, including APIs, WebSockets, and third-party integrations.
- : The main entry point for the frontend, controlling the layout, navigation, and which components are displayed.
- : Contains the global styling, including the core Matrix digital rain animation.
- : This directory contains all the modular UI pieces that make up the application. The number of components is large and growing.
- : The Product Requirements Document, which has been updated after each major phase.

**key api endpoints**
- : Gets combined real-time and simulated market data.
- : WebSocket endpoint for streaming live prices.
- : Initiates Google OAuth flow.
- : Handles the OAuth callback from Google.
- : Gets the currently authenticated user.
- : Logs the user out.
- : Gets data for a specific symbol (this was previously buggy and fixed).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Iterative Development:** The project has been built in large, rapid phases (MVP, P1, P2, P3). Be prepared to continue this pattern.
- **Memory Management:** A memory limit issue previously caused a pod termination. Be cautious with memory-intensive features, particularly TensorFlow.js.
- **Component-Based Verification:** The previous agent verified new features by adding them to the UI and taking screenshots of each new tab/component sequentially. This is a good pattern to follow before running the full testing suite.
- **User Feedback Style:** The user provides requests in short prompts and occasionally provides visual feedback via images.
